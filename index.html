                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Discussed a V&V framework that programs can use to define system-level validation goals and objectives. This framework
                        can be defined with a three-pronged approach: 1) System capabilities—what the automated driving
                        system (ADS) needs to be able to do; 2) Requirements—How to define success for the ADS; 3)
                        Operational design domain (ODD) taxonomy—Where the ADS needs to operate.

                        PAVEcast is the official podcast of Partners for Automated Vehicle Education, a nonprofit 
                        coalition working to raise the level of public knowledge about autonomous vehicle 
                        (self-driving car) technology. We discussed our recently published Verification and 
                        Validation Handbook, which offers autonomy programs principles to consider for their 
                        safety framework and best practices for establishing their V&V processes.
